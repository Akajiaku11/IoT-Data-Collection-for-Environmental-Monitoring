**IoT Data Collection for Environmental Monitoring**

📌 Overview

The IoT Data Collection for Environmental Monitoring project is designed to gather, store, and process real-time environmental data using IoT sensors. The system enables continuous monitoring of parameters such as temperature, humidity, air quality, CO₂ levels, particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10), and other environmental indicators.
This solution is ideal for climate research, pollution tracking, smart agriculture, and disaster management applications.
🎯 Key Features

    Multi-Sensor Integration: Supports temperature, humidity, CO₂, PM sensors, and more.

    Real-Time Data Acquisition: Continuous streaming via Wi-Fi, LoRa, or GSM.

    Cloud/Local Storage: Send data to cloud services (AWS, Azure, ThingsBoard, Firebase) or a local database.

    Visualization Dashboard: Real-time graphs and historical trend analysis.

    Alerts & Notifications: Threshold-based alerts via email/SMS.

    Low-Power Operation: Optimized for long-term field deployment.

    Scalable Design: Easily extendable to support more sensors and locations.

🧰 Requirements
Hardware

    IoT board (ESP32, Arduino, or Raspberry Pi)

    Environmental sensors (DHT22, MQ-135, SDS011, SGP30, etc.)

    Power supply or battery pack

    Communication module (Wi-Fi, LoRa, GSM)

Software

    Arduino IDE / PlatformIO / Python 3.x

    Cloud platform (optional): AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub, Firebase, or ThingsBoard

    Database: MySQL, InfluxDB, or MongoDB

    Dashboard tools: Grafana, Power BI, or custom web app

🚀 Setup & Installation
1. Hardware Assembly

    Connect sensors to the IoT board as per wiring diagram in /hardware_designs.

2. Firmware Upload

    Open /firmware in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

    Update Wi-Fi credentials and API endpoints in the configuration file.

    Upload to the IoT board.

3. Server Setup

    Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the server:

    python server.py

4. Dashboard

    Open /dashboard folder and start the visualization tool.

    Connect to the database or cloud endpoint.

📊 Data Flow

    Sensor Node reads environmental parameters.

    Data is sent via MQTT/HTTP to the server.

    Server stores readings in the database.

    Dashboard fetches and visualizes data in real-time.

    Alerts are triggered if thresholds are exceeded.

📈 Example Applications

    Air Quality Monitoring in urban areas.

    Climate Research Stations for weather trend analysis.

    Smart Agriculture for precision farming.

    Disaster Response (e.g., wildfire smoke detection, flood early warning).
