# IoT-Data-Collection-for-Environmental-Monitoring
This project demonstrates a real-time data pipeline designed for IoT sensors that monitor environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. The pipeline ingests sensor data continuously, processes it, and stores the information into an SQLite database for future analysis.
